## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/]

### What I learned

I learned that with HTML and CSS only, centering a div is quite a challenge especially that I used to use framework like Bootstrap. I tried making it in plain HTML and CSS only but eventually decided to use Bootstrap to make it easy. Bootstrap is a framework with built in classes that makes styling easy and makes your code shorter.
